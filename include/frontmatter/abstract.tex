\section*{Abstract}

Sized types are a type-based termination checking mechanism for dependently
typed languages. Compared to current syntactic termination checkers, sized types
make termination checking more compositional and allow for an elegant treatment
of coinductive types.

In this thesis, I investigate λST, a simply-typed lambda calculus with sized
types similar to those of Agda, a dependently typed proof assistant. My primary
contribution is a relationally parametric reflexive graph model which
demonstrates that the sizes of λST are irrelevant at runtime. The calculus and
model are fully formalised in Agda (without sized types).
