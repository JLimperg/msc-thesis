\section*{Abstract}

Sized types are a type-based termination checking mechanism for dependently
typed languages. Compared to syntactic termination checkers, sized types make
termination checking more modular and allow for an elegant treatment of
coinductive and nested data types.

This thesis investigates λST, a simply-typed lambda calculus with sized types
similar to those of Agda. The primary contribution is a relationally parametric
reflexive graph model which suggests that the sizes of λST are irrelevant at
runtime. The calculus and model are fully formalised in Agda (without sized
types).
