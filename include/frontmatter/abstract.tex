\section*{Abstract}

Sized types are a type-based termination checking mechanism for dependently
typed languages. Compared to syntactic termination checkers, sized types make
termination checking more modular and allow for an elegant treatment of
coinductive and nested data types.

This thesis investigates λST, a simply-typed lambda calculus with sized types
similar to those of Agda. Its primary contribution is a relationally parametric
denotational semantics for λST in the form of a reflexive graph model. In this
model, sizes are irrelevant: they do not affect the result of any computations.
The calculus and model are fully formalised in Agda (without sized types).
