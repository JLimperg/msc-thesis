TODO

CONTRABUSHONS (TODO words):

\begin{itemize}
\item I define a calculus, λST, that extends the simply-typed lambda calculus
  with sized types (TODO ref). The calculus, lacking dependent types and
  inductive families, is quite far removed from Agda proper, but its sized types
  are reasonably similar to Agda's. As such, studying λST may reveal issues
  specific to sized types in an otherwise simple setting. The calculus could
  also form the basis of future work which better approximates Agda.
\item I give a model of λST in terms of (a slight variation of) reflexive graphs
  (TODO ref). The model suggests (TODO can I get away w/ sth stronger here?)
  that λST is size-irrelevant, meaning that size expressions could safely be
  erased at runtime.
\item I have fully formalised both λST and the reflexive graph model in Agda.
  This presents some technical difficulties which I detail, along with their
  solutions, in (TODO ref)'
\item I briefly describe two approaches to modeling λST that initially looked
  promising but turned out to be inadequate (TODO ref). I also discuss some
  issues that present themselves when trying to extend the model to a calculus
  with infinitely branching sized types (TODO ref).
\end{itemize}
