\section*{Acknowledgements}

I am grateful, first and foremost, to my supervisor Andreas Abel. He suggested
this project and supported me from start to finish, even when some of my
questions led to lengthy evening coding sessions.

Equally important was Andrea Vezzosi, effectively my co-supervisor. Among other
things, he discovered crucial flaws in two early attempts to model sized types
and pointed me to the literature on reflexive graph models, which was essential
for the project's success.

This document benefited greatly from comments on earlier drafts by Andreas Abel,
Fabian Glöckle, Helen Goppelt, John Hughes and Ayberk Tosun.

Many people made my time at Chalmers better. To name but a few: Andreas Abel,
Jesper Cockz and Sandro Stucki organised the Initial Types Club, which was more
interesting than any official course and whose participants were always up for
discussions about more or less crazy ideas. Freðerik Hanghøj Iversen, Nachiappan
Valliappan, Pierre Kraft and Siavash Hamedani set up a category theory
self-study course, graciously supervised by Thierry Coquand, which turned out to
be perhaps the second-most important university course I have taken.

Finally, by far the biggest thanks goes to my family: my parents, sister and
grandparents. Their unwavering, unconditional support made this whole journey
possible.
