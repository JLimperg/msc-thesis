\chapter{Reflexive Graph Model}
\label{sec:model}

I now present a reflexive graph model of λST. The model is very similar to the
standard set-theoretic models of (dependent) type theories, but it additionally
captures a parametricity property: When we interpret a term $f ∶ \All{n}{T}$,
we get a dependent function $⟦f⟧ ∶ (n ∶ \Size) → ⟦T⟧(n)$, but this
function is parametric in the size -- i.e., the result of $⟦f⟧$ is independent,
in an appropriate sense, of which $n$ we apply it to.

To develop this model, I first introduce its central structure, (propositional)
reflexive graphs and their families. I then show how to interpret each
construct of λST (sizes, types and terms) in turn.


\section{Propositional Reflexive Graphs}
\label{sec:model:rgraph}

This section introduces the category of reflexive graphs, which will be used
to interpret sizes and size contexts. The results are formalised in
\texttt{Model.\allowbreak RGraph}.

A \Def{reflexive graph} is a tuple $(Δ, ≈_Δ, \refl_Δ)$ where
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  Δ &∶& \Type \\
  ≈_Δ &∶& Δ → Δ → \Type \\
  \refl_Δ(δ) &∶& δ ≈_Δ δ &\quad ∀ δ ∶ Δ.
\end{AlignAnnot*}
We will identify a reflexive graph with its underlying type where this is
unambiguous.

The relation $≈_Δ$ is what distinguishes this model from the standard
set-theoretical model of type theory. As we interpret the constructions of λST
in the next sections, we will define $≈_Δ$ to be \enquote*{equality up to
  sizes}. For example, the interpretation $⟦Δ⟧$ of a size context $Δ$ will have
$δ ≈_{⟦Δ⟧} δ′$ for all $δ$ and $δ′$ because any two interpretations of a size
context should be considered equal up to sizes.

\begin{remark}
  Each reflexive graph is isomorphic to a presheaf over a particular category.
  Thus, reflexive graphs form a category with families \cite{dybjer1995}, i.e.\ a
  model of Martin-Löf type theory. It is thus not surprising that λST also
  admits a reflexive graph model. Moreover, many of the following results are
  direct consequences of the theory of presheaves, but to keep the presentation
  elementary, I make the constructions explicit.
\end{remark}

A reflexive graph $Δ$ is \Def{propositional} if $≈_Δ$ is a proposition (i.e.\ for
any $δ, δ′ ∶ Δ$ and $p, q ∶ δ ≈_Δ δ′$, $p = q$) and the underlying type $Δ$ is a
set (i.e.\ equality on $Δ$ is a proposition). We call such a graph a
\Def{PRGraph}. These conditions are trivially fulfilled for all the PRGraphs we
consider, so I will silently omit their proofs.

PRGraphs are simpler than general reflexive graphs because the proofs
$\refl_Δ(δ)$ are irrelevant. This saves us a lot of effort, particularly in the
formalisation. However, it means that the model probably would not accommodate
theories where the identity type is non-propositional, such as cubical type
theories.

Homomorphisms of PRGraphs are relation-preserving functions. More explicitly, a
\Def{PRGraph morphism} between PRGraphs $Δ$ and $Ω$ is a function $σ$ between
their underlying types such that
\begin{displaymath}
  δ ≈_Δ δ′ ⇒ σ(δ) ≈_Ω σ(δ′) \quad ∀ δ, δ′ ∶ Δ.
\end{displaymath}
Given a proof $p ∶ δ ≈_Δ δ′$, I will occasionally write $σ(p) ∶ σ(δ) ≈_Ω σ(δ′)$.
Not very often, though, since by propositionality of $Ω$ it does not matter
which specific proof of $σ(δ) ≈_Ω σ(δ′)$ we consider. This also means that in
particular $σ(\refl_Δ(δ)) = \refl_Ω(σ(δ))$; for non-propositional RGraphs, we
would have to add this condition to the definition of morphisms.

PRGraphs and their morphisms form a category in the obvious way. We call this
category $\mathit{PRGraphs}$.


\section{Families of Propositional Reflexive Graphs}
\label{sec:model:rgraphfam}

To interpret types and type contexts, which are indexed by some size context, we
need to move from PRGraphs to \emph{families} of PRGraphs. These may be thought
of as PRGraphs indexed by PRGraphs. The results in this section are formalised
in \texttt{Model.\allowbreak Type.\allowbreak Core}.

A \Def{family of PRGraphs} over a given PRGraph $Δ$ is a tuple $(T, ≈_{T,p},
\refl_T)$ where
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  T &∶& Δ → \Type \\
  ≈_{T,p} &∶& T(δ) → T(δ′) → \Type &\quad ∀ p ∶ δ ≈_Δ δ′ \\
  \refl_T(x) &∶& x ≈_{T,\refl_Δ(δ)} x &\quad ∀ x ∶ T(δ)
\end{AlignAnnot*}
such that $T(δ)$ is a set for any $δ$ and $≈_{T,p}$ is a proposition for any $T$
and $p$.

Note that our \enquote*{equality up to sizes} is now heterogeneous: We can ask
whether an inhabitant of $T(δ)$ is equal to an inhabitant of $T(δ′)$, as long as
$δ$ and $δ′$ are equal up to sizes. In the model, $δ$ and $δ′$ will be
(interpretations of) size valuations, which are always equal up to sizes. We
will thus be able to compare, for example, (interpretations of) terms in
$\Nat{n}$ and $\Nat{m}$ for arbitrary $n$ and $m$. This is necessary as well: If
λST is indeed size-irrelevant and we take a term $t ∶ \All{n}{\Nat{v_0}}$, we
should be able to conclude that $\sapp{t}{m}$ and $\sapp{t}{m′}$ are equal up to
sizes even though these terms have types $\Nat{m}$ and $\Nat{m′}$ respectively.

Morphisms of PRGraph families are again relation-preserving functions; we just
need to carry around some more indices. To be precise, a \Def{morphism between
  PRGraph families $T$ and $U$} over the PRGraph $Δ$ is a family
of functions
\begin{displaymath}
  f_δ ∶ T(δ) → U(δ) \quad ∀ δ ∶ Δ
\end{displaymath}
such that
\begin{displaymath}
  x ≈_{T,p} y ⇒ f(x) ≈_{U,p} f(y) \quad ∀ p ∶ δ ≈_Δ δ′;\; x ∶ T(δ);\; y ∶ T(δ′).
\end{displaymath}
PRGraph families over a given PRGraph $Δ$ and their morphisms form an obvious
category which we call $\PRGraphFams(Δ)$.

The last basic construction on PRGraph families is the interpretation of size
substitution. Size substitutions $σ ∶ Δ ⇒ Ω$ will be modelled as PRGraph
morphisms $⟦σ⟧ ∶ ⟦Δ⟧ → ⟦Ω⟧$, so we must say what it means to apply such a
morphism to a family of PRGraphs over $⟦Ω⟧$. To that end, we define
\Def{semantic substitution}: Given a PRGraph morphism $σ ∶ Δ → Ω$ and a family
of PRGraphs $T$ over $Ω$, the application of $σ$ to $T$, $\sub{T}{σ}$, is the
following PRGraph family over $Δ$:
\begin{Align*}
  (\sub{T}{σ})(δ) &≔& T(σ(δ)) \\
  \mathord{≈_{\sub{T}{σ},p}} &≔& \mathord{≈_{T,σ(p)}} \\
  \refl_{\sub{T}{σ}}(x) &≔& \refl_T(x)
\end{Align*}
The last equation is not immediately well-typed: $\refl_T(x)$ proves $x
≈_{T,\refl_Δ(σ(δ))} x$ (assuming $x ∶ T(σ(δ))$) whereas we need to prove $x
≈_{T,σ(\refl_Δ(δ))} x$. However, since $≈_Δ$ is propositional, $\refl_Δ(σ(δ))$
and $σ(\refl_Δ(δ))$ are, in fact, the same.


\section{Properties of PRGraphFams}
\label{sec:model:prgraphfam-properties}

As usual, we will interpret the contexts of λST as iterated products of types
and the function space as an exponential. We therefore prove that
$\PRGraphFams(Δ)$ admits these constructions. Throughout this section, $Δ$ is an
arbitrary PRGraph.

\subsection{Finite Products}
\label{sec:model:product}

The following results are formalised in \texttt{Model.\allowbreak Terminal} and
\texttt{Model.\allowbreak Product}.

Let $T, U$ be two RGraph families over $Δ$. The \Def{product of $T$ and $U$}, $T
× U$, is defined pointwise. Explicitly, it is the following RGraph family:
\begin{Align*}
  (T × U)(δ) &≔& T(δ) × U(δ) \\
  (x, x′) ≈_{T×U,p} (y, y′) &≔& x ≈_{T,p} y ∧ x′ ≈_{U,p} y′ \\
  \refl_{T×U}(x, y) &≔& (\refl_T(x), \refl_U(y)).
\end{Align*}
In the first equation, the $×$ on the right-hand side is the usual cartesian
product of types. The projections out of $T × U$, $π₁$ and $π₂$, are the usual
projections out of the product type. It is easy to check that this defines a
product in $\PRGraphFams(Δ)$.

To interpret all finite products, we additionally need a \Def{terminal object}.
This is the PRGraph family $⊤$ (formalised in \texttt{Model.\allowbreak
  Terminal}) with
\begin{Align*}
  ⊤(δ) &≔& ⊤ \\
  x ≈_{⊤,p} y &≔& ⊤
\end{Align*}
On the right-hand sides of the equations, $⊤$ is the unit type. The relation
$≈_⊤$ is trivial and so obviously reflexive.

\subsection{Exponentials}
\label{sec:model:exponential}

The following results are formalised in \texttt{Model.\allowbreak Exponential}.

Before we can construct exponentials, we need an auxiliary definition: Given a
family of PRGraphs $T$ over $Δ$ and an object $δ$ of $Δ$, the \Def{application
  of $T$ to $δ$}, $\Ap(T, δ)$, is the following PRGraph:
\begin{Align*}
  \Ap(T, δ) &≔& T(δ) \\
  ≈_{\Ap(T, δ)} &≔& \mathord{≈_{T,\refl_Δ(δ)}} \\
  \refl_{\Ap(T, δ)}(x) &≔& \refl_T(x).
\end{Align*}

Using $\Ap$, we define exponentials. Let $T$ and $U$ be PRGraph families over
$Δ$. The \Def{exponential of $T$ and $U$}, $T ↝ U$, is the following PRGraph
family:
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  (T ↝ U)(δ) &≔& \Ap(T, δ) → \Ap(U, δ) \\
  f ≈_{T↝U,p} g &≔& ∀ x, y.\; x ≈_{T,p} y ⇒ f(x) ≈_{U,p} g(y) & \qquad (p ∶ δ ≈_Δ δ′)
\end{AlignAnnot*}
$\Ap(T, δ) → \Ap(U, δ)$ is the type of PRGraph morphisms from $\Ap(T, δ)$ to
$\Ap(U, δ)$. The relation of $T ↝ U$ is reflexive because for any such RGraph
morphism $f$, $x ≈_{T,\refl_Δ(δ)} y$ implies $f(x) ≈_{U,\refl_Δ(δ)} f(y)$.

To prove that $T ↝ U$ is indeed an exponential, we still need currying and
evaluation morphisms. Given a morphism of PRGraph families $f ∶ T × U → V$, we
define
\begin{gather*}
  \curry(f) ∶ T → U ↝ V \\
  \curry(f)_δ(t) ≔ \fun{u}{f(t, u)}.
\end{gather*}
It is easy to check that $\curry(f)_δ(t)$ is a PRGraph morphism from
$\Ap(U, δ)$ to $\Ap(V, δ)$ and that $\curry(f)$ is a morphism of PRGraph
families. We also define an evaluation morphism:
\begin{gather*}
  \eval ∶ (T ↝ U) × T → U \\
  \eval(f, t) ≔ f(t).
\end{gather*}
Again, it is easy to check that $\eval$ is a morphism of PRGraph families and
that $T ↝ U$ together with $\curry$ and $\eval$ is an exponential in
$\PRGraphFams(Δ)$.


\section{Sizes}
\label{sec:model:sizes}

With the central notions defined, we can proceed to model λST. We start with
sizes, whose interpretation is formalised in \texttt{Model.\allowbreak Size}.

A \Def{semantic size} is an ordinal below $ω·2$. These ordinals are either
natural numbers or they have the form $ω + i$ for some $i ∈ ℕ$. They are ordered
by the usual strict comparison of sizes, meaning
\begin{displaymath}
  0 < 1 < \dots < ω < ω + 1 < \dots
\end{displaymath}
The reflexive closure of $<$ is called $≤$. We write $\Size$ for the type of
sizes and $\Size_{<n}$ for the type of sizes $m$ such that $m < n$.

% The orders $<$ and $≤$ largely behave as expected. In particular, we will need
% the following properties, which are all easy to prove.

% \begin{lemma}[Properties of $<$ and $≤$]
%   \label{lem:<-props}
%   For arbitrary sizes $n$, $m$, $o$, we have:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item $<$ and $≤$ are transitive.
%     \item If $n ≤ m$ and $m < o$ then $n < o$. If $n < m$ and $m ≤ o$ then $n < o$.
%     \item $0 ≤ n$.
%     \item If $n < m$ then $n + 1 ≤ m$.
%     \item If $n + 1 ≤ m$ then $n < m$.
%     \item $<$ is irreflexive, $≤$ is antisymmetric.
%     \item $<$ is well-founded, i.e.\ there is no infinite descending chain $n₀ >
%       n₁ > \dots$.
%   \end{enumerate}
% \end{lemma}

Syntactic sizes are now modelled by semantic sizes. A size context $Δ$ is
interpreted as an iterated product of sizes. A well-typed size in $Δ$ is
interpreted as a function from $Δ$ to $\Size$. These interpretations are
mutually recursively defined:
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  ⟦()⟧ &≔& ⊤ &\qquad \text{($⊤$ is the unit type)} \\
  ⟦\ctx{Δ}{n}⟧ &≔& \Sigma_{δ ∶ ⟦Δ⟧}\Size_{<⟦n⟧(δ)} \\
  \\
  ⟦v_0⟧(δ, n) &≔& n \\
  ⟦v_{x+1}⟧(δ, n) &≔& ⟦v_x⟧(δ) \\
  ⟦0⟧(δ) &≔& 0 \\
  ⟦\ssuc{n}⟧(δ) &≔& ⟦n⟧(δ) + 1 \\
  ⟦∞⟧(δ) &≔& ω \\
\end{AlignAnnot*}

We will also consider $⟦Δ⟧$ as a PRGraph whose underlying type is $⟦Δ⟧$ and
whose relation is trivial, i.e.\ any two elements are related. A size
interpretation $⟦n⟧$ is then a PRGraph morphism (if we similarly treat the
type $\Size$ as a trivial PRGraph).

\begin{remark}
  We will shortly interpret a type $T$ in a context $Δ$ as a family of PRGraphs
  indexed by the PRGraph $⟦Δ⟧$. However, since $⟦Δ⟧$ is always trivial as a
  PRGraph, we could also interpret $T$ as a family of PRGraphs indexed by the
  \emph{type} $⟦Δ⟧$, which would be a little simpler. I choose not to do so
  because that model would likely not support dependent types (and perhaps other
  interesting features).
\end{remark}

Our interpretation of sizes is well-behaved with respect to size comparison:

\begin{lemma}[Interpretation of $<$]
  \label{lem:⟦<⟧}
  If $Δ ⊢ n < m$ and $δ ∶ ⟦Δ⟧$ then $⟦n⟧ δ < ⟦m⟧ δ$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  By induction on the derivation of $Δ ⊢ n < m$. In the case where $n$ is a
  variable, we need to use the following fact: given $Δ ⊢ n$, $Δ ⊢ m$ and $(δ,
  o) ∶ ⟦\ctx{Δ}{n}⟧$, we have $⟦\wk(m)⟧(δ, o) = ⟦m⟧(δ)$.
\end{proof}

This concludes the interpretation of sizes. Next, we interpret size
substitutions as functions between interpretations of size contexts. As
explained in \secref{formalisation:sub}, the results presented here are not
exactly those formalised.

Let $σ ∶ Δ ⇒ Ω$ be a well-typed substitution. The interpretation of $σ$ is a
function from $⟦Δ⟧$ to $⟦Ω⟧$ defined by recursion on the derivation of $σ ∶ Δ ⇒
Ω$:
\begin{gather*}
  ⟦()⟧ ∶ ⟦Δ⟧ → ⟦()⟧ \\
  ⟦()⟧(δ) ≔ \mathord{tt} \qquad \text{($\mathord{tt}$ is the unique value of $⊤$)} \\
  \\
  ⟦\ssub{σ}{n}⟧ ∶ ⟦Δ⟧ → \Sigma_{ω ∶ ⟦Ω⟧}\Size_{<⟦m⟧(ω)} \\
  ⟦\ssub{σ}{n}⟧(δ) ≔ ⟦σ⟧(δ), n
\end{gather*}
The last equation is well-typed because $\ssub{σ}{n} ∶ Δ ⇒ \ctx{Ω}{m}$ implies
$Δ ⊢ n < \sub{m}{σ}$ and thus by Lemma \ref{lem:⟦<⟧} $⟦n⟧ < ⟦\sub{m}{σ}⟧$. The
following Lemma \ref{lem:⟦sub⟧} then lets us conclude $⟦n⟧ < ⟦m⟧(⟦σ⟧(δ))$. (This
means that the present definition and Lemma \ref{lem:⟦sub⟧} are in fact mutually
recursive.)

\begin{lemma}[Interpretation of size substitutions is correct]
  \label{lem:⟦sub⟧}
  If $σ ∶ Δ ⇒ Ω$ and $Ω ⊢ n$ then $⟦\sub{σ}{n}⟧ = ⟦n⟧ ∘ ⟦σ⟧$.
\end{lemma}

We will also need to know the interpretations of some of the specific
substitutions from \secref{source:sub}. The following lemma tells us how they
behave when applied to a size valuation.

\begin{lemma}[Interpretation of specific size substitutions]
  \label{lem:sub-app}
  Assume $(δ, m, k) ∶ ⟦\ctx{\ctx{Ω}{n}}{v_0}⟧$, $σ ∶ Δ → Ω$ and $τ ∶ Ω → Ω′$. Then we have
  \begin{AlignAnnot*}
    ⟦\Id⟧(δ) &=& δ \\
    ⟦σ \fcomp τ⟧(δ) &=& ⟦τ⟧(⟦σ⟧(δ)) \\
    ⟦\Wk⟧(δ, m) &=& δ \\
    ⟦\Sing(o)⟧(δ) &=& (ω, ⟦o⟧(δ)) & \quad (o < ⟦n⟧(δ)) \\
    ⟦\Lift(σ)⟧(δ, m) &=& (⟦σ⟧(δ), m) \\
    ⟦\Skip⟧(δ, m, k) &=& (δ, k)
  \end{AlignAnnot*}
\end{lemma}


\section{Types}
\label{sec:model:types}

In this section, we model the types of λST. The following results are formalised
in \texttt{Model.\allowbreak Nat}, \texttt{Model.\allowbreak Stream} and
\texttt{Model.\allowbreak Quantification}.

As foreshadowed, we interpret well-scoped types $T$ in a size context $Δ$ as
families of PRGraphs $⟦T⟧$ over the PRGraph $⟦Δ⟧$. The interpretations of sized
naturals, sized streams and functions are straightforward; only size
quantification will be slightly more complex.

Let $ℕ_{≤n}$ be the type of natural numbers $m$ such that $m ≤ n$ (with $n$
an arbitrary size). The interpretation of $Δ ⊢ \Nat{n}$ is the following
family of PRGraphs:
\begin{Align*}
  ⟦\Nat{n}⟧(δ) &≔& ℕ_{≤ ⟦n⟧(δ)} \\
  i ≈_{⟦\Nat{n}⟧,p} j &≔& i = j.
\end{Align*}

Streams are interpreted in a similar fashion. The interpretation of $Δ ⊢
\Stream{n}$ is the following family of PRGraphs:
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  ⟦\Stream{n}⟧(δ) &≔& ℕ_{≤ ⟦n⟧(δ)} → ℕ \\
  f ≈_{⟦\Stream{n}⟧,p} g &≔& \all{m ≤ \min(⟦n⟧(δ), ⟦n⟧(δ′))}{f(m) = g(m)} &\quad
    (p ∶ δ ≈_{Δ} δ′)
\end{AlignAnnot*}

The function space is interpreted by the exponential of PRGraph families from
\secref{model:exponential}:
\begin{displaymath}
  ⟦T → U⟧ ≔ ⟦T⟧ ↝ ⟦U⟧.
\end{displaymath}

Size quantification requires a little more effort. We want to think of the terms
of $\All{n}{T}$ as functions which take a size argument, but they should be
parametric in that argument: When we apply such a function to different sizes,
it should return results that are equal up to sizes. More precisely: Let $T$ be
a family of PRGraphs over $⟦\ctx{Δ}{n}⟧$ and let $δ ∶ ⟦Δ⟧$. A function
\begin{displaymath}
  f ∶ (m ∶ \Size_{<⟦n⟧(δ)}) → T(δ, m)
\end{displaymath}
is \Def{size-parametric} if
\begin{displaymath}
  f(m) ≈_T f(m′) \quad ∀ m, m′ ∶ \Size_{<⟦n⟧(δ)}.
\end{displaymath}
This equation is well-typed because $≈_{⟦\ctx{Δ}{n}⟧}$ is trivial, so in
particular $(δ, m) ≈_{\ctx{Δ}{n}} (δ, m′)$. We write $\Param(T,δ)$ for the type
of size-parametric functions into $T(δ, ∙)$.

Now we can interpret size quantification: The interpretation of $Δ ⊢ \All{n}{T}$
is the PRGraph family $Π(⟦n⟧, ⟦T⟧)$ with
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  Π(n, T)(δ) &≔& \Param(T,δ) \\
  f ≈_{Π(n, T)} g &≔& ∀ m, m′.\; f(m) ≈_T g(m′).
\end{AlignAnnot*}
If we think of $≈_T$ as equality up to sizes, $⟦\All{n}{T}⟧$ reflects
the intuition that when we apply a term in $\All{n}{T}$ to a size $m$, it does
not matter -- up to sizes -- which $m$ we choose.

Having interpreted all types, we can now move to type contexts. These are mere
lists of types, so they are modelled by finite products. The interpretation of
$Δ ⊢ Γ$ is defined by recursion over the derivation:
\begin{Align*}
  ⟦()⟧ &≔& ⊤ \\
  ⟦\Ctx{Γ}{T}⟧ &≔& ⟦Γ⟧ × ⟦T⟧.
\end{Align*}
$⊤$ is the terminal PRGraph family and $×$ is the product of PRGraph families,
both defined in \secref{model:product}.

With this, we have interpreted all type-level constructs of λST. What remains is
to prove a lemma about the correspondence between syntactic and semantic
substitution. To do that, we need some additional lemmas about semantic
substitution first:

\begin{lemma}[Substitution in exponentials]
  Let $T$, $U$ be PRGraph families over $Ω$ and $σ ∶ Δ → Ω$ a PRGraph morphism. Then
  \begin{displaymath}
    \sub{(T ↝ U)}{σ} = \sub{T}{σ} ↝ \sub{U}{σ}.
  \end{displaymath}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}[Substitution in quantifications]
  Let $T$ be a PRGraph family over $⟦\ctx{Ω}{n}⟧$ and $σ ∶ Δ ⇒ Ω$ a well-typed
  substitution. Then
  \begin{displaymath}
    \sub{Π(n, T)}{⟦σ⟧} = Π(\sub{n}{⟦σ⟧}, \sub{T}{⟦\Lift(σ)⟧}).
  \end{displaymath}
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
  The correct equality for PRGraph families is isomorphism in $\PRGraphFams(Δ)$,
  so the $=$ above really means $≅$. This abuse of notation is justified because
  in the formalisation, isomorphic PRGraph families are in fact propositionally
  equal (by univalence).
\end{remark}

From the previous two lemmas follows the main substitution lemma for types and
contexts:

\begin{lemma}[Interpretation of substitution in types and contexts is correct]
  \label{lem:⟦subT⟧}
  If $Ω ⊢ T$ and $σ ∶ Δ ⇒ Ω$ then
  \begin{displaymath}
    ⟦\sub{T}{σ}⟧ = \sub{⟦T⟧}{⟦σ⟧}
  \end{displaymath}
  and similar for contexts.
\end{lemma}


\section{Terms}
\label{sec:model:terms}

Well-typed terms (more precisely, judgments $Δ;Γ ⊢ t ∶ T$) are interpreted as
morphisms between the PRGraph families $⟦Γ⟧$ and $⟦T⟧$. In this section, we show
a natural interpretation of each of the terms of λST. Formalisations of these
definitions can be found in \texttt{Model.\allowbreak Term}.

\subsection{Functions}
\label{sec:model:terms:functions}

Recall that the function space is modelled by the exponential $⟦T⟧ ↝ ⟦U⟧$ as in
the standard categorical model of the simply-typed lambda calculus. Accordingly,
the interpretations of its constructor, abstraction, and eliminator,
application, are also standard.

To interpret $\lam{T}{t}$, we may assume a morphism $⟦t⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ × ⟦T⟧ → ⟦U⟧$. We
then define
\begin{Align*}
  ⟦\lam{T}{t}⟧ &∶& ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦T⟧ ↝ ⟦U⟧ \\
  ⟦\lam{T}{t}⟧ &≔& \curry(⟦t⟧).
\end{Align*}

The interpretation of $\app{t}{u}$, assuming $⟦t⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦T ↝ U⟧$ and $⟦u⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ →
⟦T⟧$, is
\begin{Align*}
  ⟦\app{t}{u}⟧ &∶& ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦U⟧ \\
  ⟦\app{t}{u}⟧ &≔& \eval ∘ \anglebrackets{⟦t⟧ × ⟦u⟧}.
\end{Align*}
The operator
\begin{displaymath}
  ⟨∙×∙⟩ ∶ (A → A′) → (B → B′) → A × B → A′ × B′
\end{displaymath}
can be defined in any category with products.


\subsection{Size Quantification}
\label{sec:model:terms:quantification}

To interpret size quantification, we must consider size abstractions and size
applications. Their typing rules are reproduced in
\figref{typing:quantification} for reference.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule{\ctx{Δ}{n}; \sub{Γ}{\Wk} ⊢ t ∶ T \\ Δ ⊢ Γ}
      {Δ; Γ ⊢ \slam{n}{t} ∶ \All{n}{T}}

    \inferrule{Δ; Γ ⊢ t ∶ \All{n}{T} \\ Δ ⊢ m < n}
      {Δ; Γ ⊢ \sapp{t}{m} ∶ \sub{T}{\Sing(m)}}
  \end{mathpar}

  \caption{Typing rules for terms related to size quantification}
  \label{fig:typing:quantification}
\end{figure}

When interpreting size quantification, we may assume a morphism $⟦t⟧ ∶
⟦\sub{Γ}{\Wk}⟧ → ⟦T⟧$ with components
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  ⟦t⟧_{(δ,n)} &∶& ⟦\sub{Γ}{\Wk}⟧(δ, n) → ⟦T⟧(δ, n) \\
    &=& \sub{⟦Γ⟧}{⟦\Wk⟧}(δ, n) → ⟦T⟧(δ, n) &\quad \text{(by Lemma \ref{lem:⟦subT⟧})} \\
    &=& ⟦Γ⟧(⟦\Wk⟧(δ, n)) → ⟦T⟧(δ, n) &\quad \text{(by definition)} \\
    &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦T⟧(δ, n) &\quad \text{(by Lemma \ref{lem:sub-app}).}
\end{AlignAnnot*}
We then define
\begin{gather*}
  ⟦\slam{n}{t}⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦\All{n}{T}⟧ \\
  ⟦\slam{n}{t}⟧_δ(γ) ≔ \fun{m < ⟦n⟧(δ)}{⟦t⟧_{(δ,m)}(γ)}.
\end{gather*}
This definition is valid due to the following observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The right-hand side of the equation is a size-parametric function.
  Recall that $(δ, m) ≈_{⟦\ctx{Δ}{n}⟧} (δ, m′)$ for all $m, m′$. We also have
  $γ ≈_{⟦Γ⟧} γ$ by reflexivity and this implies $⟦t⟧_{(δ, m)}(γ) ≈_{⟦T⟧}
  ⟦t⟧_{(δ, m′)}(γ)$ because $⟦t⟧$ is a morphism of PRGraph families.
\item $⟦\slam{n}{t}⟧$ is a morphism of PRGraph families. This follows from
  essentially the same argument, only replacing the fact $γ ≈_{⟦Γ⟧} γ$ with an
  assumption $γ ≈_{⟦Γ⟧} γ′$ for some arbitrary $γ′$.
\end{itemize}

Moving to size application, we may assume a morphism
\begin{displaymath}
  ⟦t⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦\All{n}{T}⟧.
\end{displaymath}
and we construct the morphism
\begin{AlignAnnot*}
  ⟦\sapp{t}{m}⟧_δ &∶& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦\sub{T}{\Sing(m)}⟧ \\
    &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦T⟧(δ, ⟦m⟧(δ)) &\quad \text{(by Lemmas \ref{lem:⟦subT⟧} and
      \ref{lem:sub-app})} \\
  ⟦\sapp{t}{m}⟧_δ(γ) &≔& ⟦t⟧_δ(γ, ⟦m⟧(δ)).
\end{AlignAnnot*}
The size $⟦m⟧(δ)$ is a valid argument to $⟦t⟧_δ(γ)$ because we have $Δ ⊢ m < n$
and thus (by Lemma \ref{lem:⟦<⟧}) $⟦m⟧(δ) < ⟦n⟧(δ)$ for all $δ$. $⟦\sapp{t}{m}⟧$
is a morphism of PRGraph families because $⟦t⟧$ is.


\subsection{Natural Numbers}
\label{sec:model:terms:nat}

The sized natural number type $\Nat{n}$ has two constructors, zero and
successor, and an eliminator $\mathrm{caseNat}$. Their typing rules are
reproduced in \figref{typing:nat} for reference. Recall that $\Nat{n}$ is
modelled by the type of natural numbers less than or equal to a size $n$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule{Δ ⊢ n < \Star \\ Δ ⊢ Γ}{Δ; Γ ⊢ \zero{n} ∶ \Nat{n}}

    \inferrule{Δ ⊢ n < \Star \\ Δ ⊢ m < n \\ Δ; Γ ⊢ i ∶ \Nat{m}}
    {Δ; Γ ⊢ \suc{n}{m}{i} ∶ \Nat{n}}

    \inferrule{Δ ⊢ T \\ Δ ⊢ n < \Star \\ Δ; Γ ⊢ i ∶ \Nat{n} \\ Δ; Γ ⊢ z ∶ T \\
      Δ; Γ ⊢ s ∶ \All{n}{\Nat{v_0} → \sub{T}{\Wk}}}
    {Δ; Γ ⊢ \case{T}{n}{i}{z}{s} ∶ T}
  \end{mathpar}
  \caption{Typing rules for terms related to $\Nat{n}$}
  \label{fig:typing:nat}
\end{figure}

The term $\zero{n}$ is interpreted by
\begin{displaymath}
  ⟦\zero{n}⟧_δ(γ) ≔ 0.
\end{displaymath}
This is valid since $0 ≤ n$ for all $n$.

To interpret the successor, given a morphism $⟦i⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦\Nat{n}⟧$, we define
\begin{displaymath}
  ⟦\suc{n}{m}{i}⟧_δ(γ) ≔ ⟦i⟧_δ(γ) + 1.
\end{displaymath}
This is valid because we have $⟦i⟧_δ(γ) ≤ ⟦m⟧(δ)$ (by definition of $⟦\Nat{m}⟧$)
and $⟦m⟧(δ) < ⟦n⟧(δ)$ (by Lemma \ref{lem:⟦<⟧}), which implies $⟦i⟧_δ(γ) + 1 ≤
⟦n⟧(δ)$.

To interpret the eliminator $\mathrm{caseNat}$, we assume morphisms $⟦i⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ →
⟦\Nat{n}⟧$, $⟦z⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦T⟧$ and $⟦s⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦\All{n}{\Nat{v_0} →
  \sub{T}{\Wk}}⟧$. The interpretation is then
\begin{displaymath}
  ⟦\case{T}{n}{i}{z}{s}⟧_δ(γ) ≔
    \begin{cases}
      ⟦z⟧_δ(γ) &\quad \text{if $⟦i⟧_δ(γ) = 0$} \\
      ⟦s⟧_δ(γ, ⟦n⟧(δ) - 1, ⟦i⟧_δ(γ) - 1) &\quad \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{displaymath}
Note that in the second branch, $⟦n⟧(δ)$ cannot be zero because $⟦i⟧_δ(γ) ≤
⟦n⟧(δ)$ and $⟦i⟧_δ(γ) ≠ 0$.


\subsection{Streams}
\label{sec:model:terms:stream}

Sized streams are constructed by the term $\mathrm{cons}$ and eliminated by
$\mathrm{head}$ and $\mathrm{tail}$. The typing rules of these terms are
reproduced in \figref{typing:stream}. Recall that the model of $\Stream{n}$ is
the type of functions $ℕ_{≤n} → ℕ$.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{mathpar}
    \inferrule{Δ ⊢ n < \Star \\ Δ; Γ ⊢ i ∶ \Nat{∞} \\
      Δ; Γ ⊢ \V{is} ∶ \All{n}{\Stream{v_0}}}
      {Δ; Γ ⊢ \cons{n}{i}{\V{is}} ∶ \Stream{n}}

    \inferrule{Δ ⊢ n < \Star \\ Δ; Γ ⊢ \V{is} ∶ \Stream{n}}
      {Δ; Γ ⊢ \head{n}{\V{is}} ∶ \Nat{∞}}

    \inferrule{Δ ⊢ n < \Star \\ Δ; Γ ⊢ \V{is} ∶ \Stream{n} \\ Δ ⊢ m < n}
      {Δ; Γ ⊢ \tail{n}{\V{is}}{m} ∶ \Stream{m}}
  \end{mathpar}
  \caption{Typing rules for terms related to $\Stream{n}$}
  \label{fig:typing:stream}
\end{figure}

To interpret $\mathrm{cons}$, we assume morphisms $⟦i⟧$ and $⟦\V{is}⟧$ with
components
\begin{Align*}
  ⟦i⟧_δ
  &∶& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦\Nat{∞}⟧(δ) \\
  &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ℕ_{<ω} \\
  &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ℕ \\
  ⟦\V{is}⟧_δ
  &∶& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦\All{n}{\Stream{v_0}}⟧(δ) \\
  &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → \Param(⟦\Stream{v_0}⟧, δ) \\
  &≈& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → (m ∶ \Size_{<⟦n⟧(δ)}) → ⟦\Stream{v_0}⟧(δ, m) \\
  &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → (m ∶ \Size_{<⟦n⟧(δ)}) → ℕ_{≤m} → ℕ.
\end{Align*}
The $≈$ on the penultimate line indicates that we are ignoring the parametricity
requirement of $\Param$ to unfold it. We then define
\begin{displaymath}
  ⟦\cons{n}{i}{\V{is}}⟧_δ(γ, k) ≔
  \begin{cases}
    ⟦i⟧_δ(γ) &\quad \text{if $k = 0$} \\
    ⟦\V{is}⟧_δ(γ, k - 1, k - 1) &\quad \text{otherwise}.
  \end{cases}
\end{displaymath}
Note that $k ≤ ⟦n⟧(δ)$, so in the second equation we have $k - 1 < ⟦n⟧(δ)$ and
obviously $k - 1 ≤ m - 1$.

The destructors of $\Stream{n}$ have less complex interpretations. For
$\mathrm{head}$, we assume a morphism $⟦\V{is}⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦\Stream{n}⟧$ and define
\begin{gather*}
  ⟦\head{n}{\V{is}}⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦\Nat{∞}⟧ \\
  ⟦\head{n}{\V{is}}⟧_δ(γ) ≔ ⟦\V{is}⟧_δ(γ, 0).
\end{gather*}
Similarly, for $\mathrm{tail}$, we assume $⟦\V{is}⟧ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧ → ⟦\Stream{n}⟧$ and $Δ
⊢ m < n$ and define
\begin{gather*}
  ⟦\tail{n}{\V{is}}{m}⟧ ∶ ⟦\Stream{m}⟧ \\
  ⟦\tail{n}{\V{is}}{m}⟧_δ(γ, k) ≔ ⟦\V{is}⟧_δ(γ, k + 1).
\end{gather*}
The application of $k + 1$ is well-typed because $k ≤ ⟦m⟧(δ)$ and $⟦m⟧(δ) <
⟦n⟧(δ)$ (by Lemma \ref{lem:⟦<⟧}).


\subsection{Fixpoint}
\label{sec:model:terms:fixpoint}

The sized fixpoint combinator is the sole means of recursion in λST. As such,
its interpretation is also recursive but otherwise mostly straightforward.

Recall the typing rule of $\mathrm{fix}$:
\begin{displaymath}
  \centering
  \inferrule{\ctx{Δ}{\Star} ⊢ T \\
    Δ; Γ ⊢ t ∶ \All{\Star}{(\All{v_0}{\sub{T}{\Skip}}) → T} \\ Δ ⊢ n < \Star}
  {Δ; Γ ⊢ \fix{T}{t}{n} ∶ \sub{T}{\Sing(n)}}
\end{displaymath}
According to this rule, we may assume a morphism $⟦t⟧$ with components
\begin{Align*}
  ⟦t⟧_δ
    &∶& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦\All{\Star}{(\All{v_0}{\sub{T}{\Skip}}) → T}⟧(δ) \\
    &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → (n ∶ \Size_{< ω + 1}) → ((m ∶ \Size_{<n}) → ⟦T⟧(⟦\Skip⟧(δ, n, m))) →
    ⟦T⟧(δ, n) \\
    &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → (n ∶ \Size_{< ω + 1}) → ((m ∶ \Size_{<n}) → ⟦T⟧(δ, m)) → ⟦T⟧(δ, n)
\end{Align*}
The first step in this chain uses the fact that $⟦\sub{T}{\Skip}⟧ =
\sub{⟦T⟧}{⟦\Skip⟧}$ (Lemma \ref{lem:⟦subT⟧}). In the second step, we simplify
$⟦\Skip⟧(δ, n, m)$ to $(δ, m)$ according to Lemma \ref{lem:sub-app}.

Given such a $⟦t⟧$, we first define the following auxiliary function:
\begin{gather*}
  f_δ ∶ ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → (n ∶ \Size_{< ω + 1}) → ⟦T⟧(δ, n) \\
  f_δ(γ, n) ≔ ⟦t⟧_δ(γ, n, \fun{m}{f_δ(γ, m)})
\end{gather*}
This function is a standard fixpoint combinator. It terminates because the
recursive call is on a size $m < n$ and $<$ is well-founded: There is no
infinite descending chain $n₀ > n₁ > \dots$ and so a recursion which always
decreases the size argument must eventually stop. Interpreting $\mathrm{fix}$ is
then just a matter of applying $f$:
\begin{Align*}
  ⟦\fix{T}{t}{n}⟧_δ
    &∶& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦\sub{T}{\Sing(n)}⟧(δ) \\
    &=& ⟦Γ⟧(δ) → ⟦T⟧(δ, ⟦n⟧(δ)) \\
  ⟦\fix{T}{t}{n}⟧_δ(γ) &≔& f_δ(γ, ⟦n⟧(δ)).
\end{Align*}

In the above argument, we have, as usual, glossed over various proof obligations
concerning size parametricity, preservation of relations and so on. However, one
of these obligations is actually nontrivial: In the definition of the auxiliary
function $f$, we use $f$ recursively as a size-parametric function. This means
that we must prove $f$ size-parametric \emph{mutually recursively} with its own
definition. The full, somewhat gory details of this construction appear in
\secref{formalisation:fixpoint}.


\section{Size Irrelevance}
\label{sec:model:conclusion}

With all elements of λST modelled, so we should briefly ask what the model tells
us. It does not immediately allow us to conclude any syntactic size irrelevance
results, which would mean, for example, that for any term $t ∶ \All{n}{T}$ and
sizes $m$, $m′$ the applications $\sapp{t}{m}$ and $\sapp{t}{m′}$ normalise to
the same value up to sizes. (Indeed, I have not even given an operational
semantics for λST.) Ideally, we would like an even stronger result: that the
entire reduction sequences of $m$ and $m′$ are equal up to sizes. This would
allow us to fully erase sizes at runtime. Answering these syntactic questions
fully would be significant additional work; I briefly return to them in
\secref{conclusion:future}.

What we do get from the model, however, is a denotational semantics of λST which
gives some \enquote*{evidence} that the calculus is size-irrelevant. Our model
construction can be read as an interpreter from λST into Agda, and this
interpreter must, due to the parametricity requirement in our interpretation of
size quantification, produce size-irrelevant functions.
